Prerequisites
Minimum hardware requirements:

Recommended hardware configuration for a small team:

4 GB+ of RAM

Software requirements:
sudo apt update
sudo apt install fontconfig openjdk-17-jre
java -version

jenkins:

sudo wget -O /usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable/jenkins.io-2023.key
echo "deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/jenkins-keyring.asc]" \
  https://pkg.jenkins.io/debian-stable binary/ | sudo tee \
  /etc/apt/sources.list.d/jenkins.list > /dev/null
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install jenkinsCertainly! Here's a step-by-step guide to set up Jenkins on a Linux system:

1. **Install Jenkins**:
   - First, you need to install Jenkins on your system. The installation method may vary depending on your Linux distribution. For example, on Ubuntu, you can use the following commands:
     ```
     sudo apt update
     sudo apt install jenkins
     ```
   - Follow the prompts to complete the installation process.

2. **Configure Jenkins as a service**:
   - Jenkins may not start automatically after installation. To configure it as a service, create a systemd service file. Create or edit the file `/etc/systemd/system/jenkins.service` using a text editor (e.g., `nano` or `vim`), and add the following content:
     ```
     [Unit]
     Description=Jenkins Automation Server
     Wants=network-online.target
     After=network-online.target

     [Service]
     Type=simple
     User=jenkins
     Group=jenkins
     ExecStart=/usr/bin/java -jar /usr/share/jenkins/jenkins.war
     Restart=always

     [Install]
     WantedBy=multi-user.target
     ```
   - Save the file and close the text editor.

3. **Create a Jenkins user**:
   - Create a dedicated user for running Jenkins. You can do this with the following command:
     ```
     sudo useradd -m -s /bin/bash jenkins
     ```

4. **Set Jenkins home directory**:
   - Jenkins requires a home directory for storing configuration and data. By default, this is set to `/var/lib/jenkins`, but you can customize it by setting the `JENKINS_HOME` environment variable in the systemd service file.

5. **Start and enable Jenkins service**:
   - Start the Jenkins service and enable it to start on system boot with the following commands:
     ```
     sudo systemctl start jenkins
     sudo systemctl enable jenkins
     ```

6. **Access Jenkins Web Interface**:
   - Jenkins should now be running and accessible through your web browser. Open your browser and navigate to `http://your_server_ip_or_domain:8080`.
   - Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the initial Jenkins setup, including unlocking Jenkins and installing recommended plugins.

7. **Configure Jenkins**:
   - Once Jenkins is unlocked and plugins are installed, you can start configuring Jenkins for your specific needs, such as creating jobs, configuring build pipelines, and setting up user authentication.

That's it! You've now set up Jenkins on your Linux system and can start using it for continuous integration and automation tasks. If you encounter any issues, you can refer to the Jenkins documentation or use the provided commands for troubleshooting.
